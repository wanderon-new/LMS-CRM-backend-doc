# Known Technical Debt

## üìã Overview
This document provides an honest assessment of the current technical debt in the Lead Processor system. Technical debt includes shortcuts, workarounds, outdated patterns, and areas requiring refactoring or improvement. Acknowledging and tracking these items is crucial for informed decision-making and future planning.

## üö® Critical Technical Debt (High Priority)

### 1. Change Data Capture (CDC) Implementation - Limited Scope
**Location**: `server/config/db.ts`, `server/services/cdc.service.ts`, availability collection only
**Issue**: CDC functionality is implemented and enabled for availability collection only, missing tracking for critical business operations
```typescript
// Current: CDC enabled only for availability tracking
const cdcResult = await cdcService.initialize({
    collections: ['users', 'availabilities'], // Limited scope
    enabled: true,
    preferChangeStreams: process.env.CDC_PREFER_CHANGE_STREAMS !== 'false'
});

// Missing: Filtration changes, user role changes, lead assignments, etc.
```
**Impact**: 
- Limited audit trail - only tracks salesperson availability changes
- Missing critical business operation tracking (filter changes, role modifications)
- No data for building insights engine (filter changes vs lead conversion analysis)
- Incomplete compliance and audit capabilities
- Cannot analyze business impact of configuration changes

**Remediation Plan**:
- Assess scalability requirements for expanding CDC to additional collections
- Implement CDC for filtration rule changes and their impact tracking
- Add CDC for user role and permission changes
- Extend CDC to cover lead assignment and conversion tracking
- Build audit mechanism and insights engine using CDC data
- Create dashboards showing filter change impact on lead conversion rates

### 2. Error Handling Inconsistencies
**Location**: Multiple controllers and services
**Issue**: Inconsistent error handling patterns across the application
```typescript
// Some places use try-catch with proper logging
try {
    await operation();
} catch (error) {
    logger.error('Operation failed:', error);
    throw error;
}

// Others have minimal error handling
const result = await operation(); // No error handling
```
**Impact**: 
- Difficult debugging in production
- Inconsistent error responses
- Missing error context

**Remediation Plan**:
- Standardize error handling middleware
- Implement consistent error response format
- Add error context tracking

### 3. Database Query Optimization
**Location**: Various repository files
**Issue**: Some queries lack proper indexing and optimization
```typescript
// Potentially slow query without proper indexing
const opportunities = await RawOpportunity.find({
    customerPhone: phone,
    createdAt: { $gte: startDate, $lte: endDate },
    'salesPerson.name': salesPersonName
}).sort({ createdAt: -1 });
```
**Impact**: 
- Slow query performance as data grows
- High database load
- Poor user experience

**Remediation Plan**:
- Audit all database queries
- Add compound indexes for common query patterns
- Implement query performance monitoring

### 4. Identity & Access Management (IAM) System Missing
**Location**: Entire application (no IAM implementation)
**Issue**: Complete absence of IAM system to create and enforce strict data access policies
```typescript
// Current: Basic authentication without granular permissions
const authGuard = createAuthGuard({ logger, tokenService, getSession });
// Missing: Role-based access control, resource-level permissions
```
**Impact**: 
- No granular data access controls
- Security risk with over-privileged users
- Difficulty in implementing least-privilege principle
- Compliance issues for data protection regulations
- No audit trail for permission changes

**Remediation Plan**:
- Design and implement comprehensive IAM system
- Create role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions
- Implement resource-level access policies
- Add permission management UI for administrators
- Create audit logs for all access control changes

### 5. User Management & Onboarding System
**Location**: Manual user creation process
**Issue**: No automated user management system, requiring manual user onboarding
```typescript

// Missing: Invitation mechanism, organizational hierarchy, automated workflows
```
**Impact**: 
- Manual overhead for user onboarding
- No organizational hierarchy representation
- Inconsistent user provisioning process
- Missing employee hierarchy-based business logic
- Poor user experience for new team members
- Security risks from manual processes

**Remediation Plan**:
- Implement invitation-based user onboarding system
- Create organizational chart/hierarchy management
- Design employee hierarchy-based business logic
- Add automated user provisioning workflows
- Implement role assignment based on organizational position
- Create user lifecycle management (activation, deactivation, role changes)

### 6. Monitoring & Observability Platform Selection & Implementation
**Location**: System-wide (platform evaluation in progress)
**Issue**: While basic logging is configured with Pino and integrations exist for BetterStack and Elastic APM, comprehensive monitoring platform needs to be finalized
```typescript
// Current: Basic logging with Pino, BetterStack (Logtail), and Elastic APM configuration
// Status: Platform evaluation between BetterStack and Elastic APM in progress
// Missing: Final platform selection, metrics collection, alerting, dashboards
```
**Impact**: 
- Limited real-time system metrics visibility
- Missing comprehensive performance monitoring and alerting
- Delayed implementation of proactive issue identification
- No SLA/SLO monitoring capabilities
- Suboptimal incident response due to incomplete observability stack

**Remediation Plan**:
- Complete evaluation of BetterStack vs Elastic APM for monitoring platform
- Finalize platform selection based on feature requirements and cost analysis
- Implement comprehensive metrics collection on chosen platform
- Set up dashboards for system and business metrics visualization
- Create alerting rules for critical system metrics and business KPIs
- Implement distributed tracing integration (already partially configured)
- Set up automated alerting and incident management workflows

### 7. Rate Limiting - In-Memory Implementation Scalability Concerns
**Location**: Rate limiting middleware (in-memory implementation)
**Issue**: Rate limiting is currently implemented using in-memory storage, limiting scalability across multiple instances
```typescript
// Current: In-memory rate limiting implementation
// Limitation: Cannot scale across multiple application instances
// Impact: Primarily affects bulk data dump APIs and few data fetching endpoints
```
**Impact**: 
- Rate limits not shared across multiple application instances
- Inconsistent rate limiting behavior in multi-instance deployments
- Potential for rate limit bypass in distributed environments

**Remediation Plan**:
- Migrate rate limiting from in-memory to Redis-based implementation
- Implement distributed rate limiting across application instances
- Add configurable rate limiting policies per API endpoint type
- Optimize for bulk data dump APIs vs regular data fetching APIs
- Add monitoring for rate limiting effectiveness and performance

### 8. Comprehensive Reporting System Missing
**Location**: System-wide (no reporting infrastructure)
**Issue**: Complete absence of comprehensive reporting functionality for business insights and analytics
```typescript
// Current: No centralized reporting system
// Missing: Business analytics, performance reports, conversion tracking
// Dependency: Requires IAM system for role-based report access
```
**Impact**: 
- No business intelligence or analytics capabilities
- Missing performance and conversion tracking reports
- Inability to analyze business trends and patterns
- No role-based access to different report types
- Manual data analysis required for business decisions

```typescript
// Authentication checks in multiple places
const authGuard = createAuthGuard({ logger, tokenService, getSession });
// Similar logic repeated in frontend middleware
```
**Impact**: 
- Code duplication
- Maintenance overhead
- Security risk if updates miss some locations

**Remediation Plan**:
- Centralize authentication logic
- Create reusable authentication decorators
- Implement unified session management

### 10. API Response Inconsistencies
**Location**: Multiple controllers
**Issue**: Inconsistent API response formats
```typescript
// Some endpoints return different structures
return { status_code: 200, data: { users } };
return { success: true, result: opportunities };
return opportunities; // Direct data return
```
**Impact**: 
- Frontend integration complexity
- API documentation confusion
- Maintenance overhead

**Remediation Plan**:
- Standardize response format using response builders
- Update all endpoints to use consistent structure
- Add response validation middleware

### 11. Frontend State Management Complexity
**Location**: `frontend/app/_redux/slices/`
**Issue**: Over-complicated Redux state for simple operations
```typescript
// Complex state management for simple UI state
const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);
// Could be local state instead of Redux
```
**Impact**: 
- Performance overhead
- Unnecessary complexity
- Difficult debugging

**Remediation Plan**:
- Audit Redux usage and move simple state to local state
- Implement state management guidelines
- Optimize Redux store structure

### 12. Configuration Management
**Location**: Multiple config files
**Issue**: Configuration scattered across different files and environments
```typescript

**Issue**: Some dependencies are outdated or have security vulnerabilities
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "some-package": "^1.0.0", // Newer version available
    "vulnerable-package": "^2.1.0" // Known vulnerabilities
  }
}
```
**Impact**: 
- Security vulnerabilities
- Missing features and performance improvements
- Technical debt accumulation

**Remediation Plan**:
- Regular dependency audits
- Implement automated dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning

### 16. Frontend Component Duplication
**Location**: `frontend/app/_components/`
**Issue**: Similar components with slight variations instead of reusable components
```typescript
// Multiple similar table components
<OpportunityTable />
<AvailabilityTable />
<UserTable />
// Could be unified into <DataTable />
```
**Impact**: 
- Code duplication
- Inconsistent UI
- Maintenance overhead

**Remediation Plan**:
- Create generic, reusable components
- Implement component composition patterns
